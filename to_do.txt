- How do we make sure versioning and rollbacks for specific files can be done? Because we definitely need a way to revert recent changes to files done by the agent.

- finish fixing install-gemini installer for bash error and inefficiency

## TEST THE DAMN THING! Gemini Tests:

- Doesn't work as well without loading all documents, or at least the main ones, sans the template and examples ones.

? Don't ask so often about if requirements meet the expectation and criteria. -keeps asking for design.. maybe valid? It should be explaining an outline of what it did as explanation and summary, with the why's and how. locate placating context and tone down.
? really wish we could call /memory compress in gemini directly or contextually for optimizing context.
? often and common 'model stream ended' api errors. Context limit? unlikely, with counts running compress, but maybe when ingesting too much info at once. mitigate with consumption practices. large differentials before and after compress shows redundant data that can be well summarized.
? 

- No need to label all requirements with numbers, mixes things up and makes lots of edits required on small changes.

- scripts are dependant on some extensions and don't play as nicely with windows, consider python or straight-up json context for the AI to do its own functions following step instructions, unless they're long and complex and precise or specialized.

+ Reading design template and requirements.md correctly when moving on to the next stage, but the agent should be a bit more proactive in moving to new stages.

## CONTINUE TESTING FROM TASK.MD, SELECT TASK!
? add recovery point of where we left off? how does it recover and review project status when reloading?
