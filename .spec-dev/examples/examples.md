# Examples

Concrete examples showing current spec-driven development patterns.

## Example Specifications

### Simple Features
- **[User Authentication](simple-feature-spec.md)** - Complete spec with YAML frontmatter, unique IDs, and JSON blocks
- **[Complex E-commerce Cart](complex-feature-spec.md)** - Multi-component feature with sub-specifications

## Key Patterns Demonstrated
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Structured metadata with health tracking
- **Unique IDs**: US-001, AC-001, DD-001, T-001 for traceability  
- **JSON Blocks**: Machine-readable data for AI consumption
- **EARS Format**: Proper acceptance criteria structure
- **Health Monitoring**: Progress tracking and quality metrics

## Usage for AI Agents
These examples show the expected output format for each phase. Use them as reference when generating specifications to ensure consistency with established patterns.
