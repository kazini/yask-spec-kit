> Need to test both 2.21 and 2.21_cf side by side.

* Must make installer(s) also remove the install-cursor file.
- Must fix cursor implementation automation, currently as a 'mode' or modified custom instruction for Plan mode, only tried as a custom mode.

* Adding Validation and Testing guidelines

-! remove dependency on spec.sh script.

-! refine cross-documentation workflow, check that when updating design, it checks if it needs to update requirements, make more open to also changing ALL docs

? Centralized prompt, must check performance, as preemptive evaluation indicates degradation of context comprehension. More testing required.


* Future:
	- look into maybe incorporating some more best practices and principles from the kiro guide docs.
	? Work on integrations.
